      "Welcome to my website!
      As a postdoctoral researcher at Apple MLR, Paris,
      I am deeply interested in how we can improve AI systems from various perspectives.
      In particular, my current research focuses on __vision-language pre-training__
      and __generative modeling__, where I take a data-centric approach and explore different
      ways to enhance data quality.<br>

      In the mean time, I have a theoretical background,
      as evidenced by my Ph.D. in __optimization__,
      __online learning__, and __learning in games__ completed under the supervision of
      [Jérôme Malick](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Jerome.Malick/),
      [Franck Iutzeler](http://www.iutzeler.org/), and
      [Panayotis Mertikopoulos](http://polaris.imag.fr/panayotis.mertikopoulos/) at Université Grenoble Alpes.
      Finally, I also contributed to the [LyCORIS](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS/) project
      that implements a number of algorithms for __efficient fine-tuning__.
      This represents an important topic in making AI more personalized and accessible."
    position: Postdoctoral Researcher
    school: Apple MLR
    # Apart from this, I am broadly interested in various topics in artificial intelligence,
    # in  lie in the intersection of optimization and machine learning, with a focus on __minimax optimization__, __online learning__, __distributed optimization__, and __learning in games__.
