      "I am a Ph.D. candidate at University of Grenoble Alpes supervised by
      [Jérôme Malick](https://ljk.imag.fr/membres/Jerome.Malick/),
      [Franck Iutzeler](http://www.iutzeler.org/), and
      [Panayotis Mertikopoulos](http://polaris.imag.fr/panayotis.mertikopoulos/).
      My current research interests lie in the intersection of optimization and machine learning, with a focus on __minimax optimization__, __online learning__, and __distributed optimization__.
      Apart from this, I am broadly interested in various topics in AI-related mathematics and am open to working on different subjects in the future. 


      Before my Ph.D., I studied computer science at ENS Paris and got a double degree MSc from the CS department of ENS Paris and the Mathematics department of ENS Paris-Saclay.
      I am serving as a reviewer for ICML, NeurIPS, and ICLR."
