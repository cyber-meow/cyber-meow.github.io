description: "Welcome to my website! As a postdoctoral researcher at Apple MLR, Paris, I am deeply interested in how we can improve AI systems from various perspectives. In particular, my current research focuses on vision-language pre-training and generative modeling, where I take a data-centric approach and explore different ways to enhance data quality. In the mean time, I have a theoretical background, as evidenced by my Ph.D. in optimization, online learning, and learning in games completed under the supervision of Jérôme Malick, Franck Iutzeler, and Panayotis Mertikopoulos at Université Grenoble Alpes. Finally, I also contributed to the LyCORIS project that implements a number of algorithms for efficient fine-tuning. This represents an important topic in making AI more personalized and accessible."
