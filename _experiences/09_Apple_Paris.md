I returned to Paris after four years of my Ph.D. pursuit, and this came with a refocusing of my research interests.
Having witnessed how large foundation models are transforming the world that we live in, I made up my mind to
work on problems that are more directly relevant to these models.
Specifically, I conducted research on vision-language models, exploring how a new image captioning format, 
[graph-based captioning](https://github.com/apple/ml-gbc), could serve as a strong alternative to traditional plain text captions when it comes to providing fine-grained and structured annotations for images.
