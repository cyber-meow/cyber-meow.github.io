I was born in Taiwan, this beautiful island on which both western democracy and eastern lifestyle can be found.
Yes, that is surprisingly rare.
Moreover, Taiwan is also considered as [one of the best places for expats living abroad](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3771983) and is the [first in Asia that legalizes same-sex marriage](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3941133).
I am proud of being Taiwanese.
