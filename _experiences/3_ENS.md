After two years of hard work. I was admitted to ENS Paris,
being ranked 1bis of the computer science group in the entrance exam (bis as I am not French).
Only during the first and half years we actually followed courses on the campus of ENS.
Besides math and computer science, I also attended several cognitive science courses (which granted me a minor in cognitive science).
