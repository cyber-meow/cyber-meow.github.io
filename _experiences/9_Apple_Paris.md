I am returning to Paris after four years of my Ph.D. pursuit, and this comes with a refocusing of my research interests.
Having witnessed how large foundation models are transforming the world that we live in, I have made up my mind to
work on problems that are more directly relevant to these models.
Meanwhile, I also want to dedicate myself to the development of open-source models and datasets so that more people can benefit
from this exciting progress of science and technology.
