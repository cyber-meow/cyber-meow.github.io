As a fan of Japanese Culture, I decided to go to Japan for my first-year master's internship.
Thanks to my kind internship advisors ([Masashi Sugiyama](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/) and [Gang Niu](https://niug1984.github.io/)) and co-workers, this internship marked the beginning of my research career.
My work centered around weakly-supervised learning and my first paper was written.
I also enjoyed very much the time off from work.
I benefited from these five months so much that I dare say that it was probably my greatest turning point after my arrival in France.
