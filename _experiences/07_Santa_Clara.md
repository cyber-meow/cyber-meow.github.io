I was fortunate to get a return internship at Amazon in the same team but at a different location.
Impressed by the performance and flexibility of score-based diffusion models, I decided to investigate how it can be incorporated as prior in multi-armed bandit problems.
This internship was thus an occasion for me to conduct a quite different type of research, in which algorithms and experiments prevail theory.
I also enjoyed the four months in the Bay Area, where I got the opportunity to meet many old friends and gained new insignts into my future career.
