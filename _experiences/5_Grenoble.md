For my second year of master, I studied
[Mathematics, Vision, and Learning](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-vision-learning) in ENS Paris-Saclay.
I then came to Grenoble for the internship, before starting my Ph.D. with my current advisors.
