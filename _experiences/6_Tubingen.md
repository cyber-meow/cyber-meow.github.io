To acquire industrial experience, I did a four-month applied science internship at Amazon in the third year of my Ph.D.
During this internship, I had the great honor to work with my internship manager [Shiva Kasiviswanathan](http://www.shivakasiviswanathan.com/) and Principal Scientist [Branislav Kveton](https://bkveton.com/) on a stochastic bandit model (see this [paper](assets/file/UpBandits.pdf)).
Additionally, being part of the Causality team, led by [Dominik Janzing](https://janzing.github.io/) and [Yasser Jadidi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasser-jadidi-795139188/), allowed me to gain an understanding of the basics of causality.
Finally, the internship provided me with valuable experience in remote collaboration, as well as an enjoyable experience living in the beautiful medieval city of Tübingen, surrounded by nature.
