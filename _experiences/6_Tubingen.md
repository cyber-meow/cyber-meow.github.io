To acquire industrial experience, I did a four-month applied science internship at Amazon in the third year of my Ph.D.
During this internship, I had the great honor to work with my internship manager [Shiva Kasiviswanathan](http://www.shivakasiviswanathan.com/) and Principal Scientist [Branislav Kveton](https://bkveton.com/) on a stochastic bandit model (see this [paper](assets/file/UpBandits.pdf)).
As I carried out my internship in a Causality team (led by [Dominik Janzing](https://janzing.github.io/)), I also learned some basics of causality during the four months.
Finally, this internship was also the occasion for me to experience remote collaboration and I, of course, enjoyed very much the life in Tübingen, a beautiful medieval city close to the nature.
