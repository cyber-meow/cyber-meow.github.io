The randomness of life brought me to France after I graduated from high school.
I got this opportunity thanks to the [CPGE Taiwan](https://france-taipei.org/Programme-d-integration-d-eleves-taiwanais-en-classes-preparatoires-aux-grandes)
program which recruit Taiwanese students to study in French classe prepa through a maths exam.
After 6 months of intensive French course in Taiwan, in July 2014, I embarked on the journey and started my study abroad life in France.
