With my passion for Japanese Culture, I decided to leave for Japan for my first year master internship.
I greatly benefited from these five months and I dare say that it was probably my greatest turning point after my leave from Taiwan.
Thanks to my kind internship advisors and co-workers, this internship marked the beginning of my research career.
I worked on weakly-supervised learning algorithms and published my first paper.
