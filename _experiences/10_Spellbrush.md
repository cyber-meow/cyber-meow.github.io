I started my research career in Tokyo, and I am now going back to Tokyo for another turning point in my life.
AI is revolutionizing everything, creating an incredible opportunity to truly build our dreams.
Some of my deepest passions lie in anime and mathematics---two seemingly unrelated fields---but it is now possible to bring them together.
We are still early, and I am excited to see where this new frontier will give.
