My passion for mathematics was already developed in my childhood.
From 12 to 18 years old, I actively participated in math competitions and spent a lot of time on Olympiad type questions.
Especially, during my second year of high school, I was so fortunate to become one of the six contestants [representing Taiwan in IMO 2013](https://www.imo-official.org/team_r.aspx?code=TWN&year=2013) after passing multiple stages of selection.
