After four years of hard work, the Ph.D. defense marked an import milestone of my academic journey.
My [Ph.D. Thesis](assets/file/Thesis.pdf) deals with mathematical frameworks and algorithms for decision-making in multi-agent systems,
making use of tools from online learning, game theory, and stochastic optimization.
The four years also came with many great experiences, including workshops in [Luminy](https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2133.html),
[Les Houches](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/OSL2023/), [Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/games-learning-and-networks/), and a lot more.
I am deeply grateful for my Ph.D. advisors for their support and guidance along these years.
